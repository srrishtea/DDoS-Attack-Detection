# DDoS Attack Detection using Ensemble Machine Learning  

> ** Cyber threats are evolving, and so should our defenses!** This project leverages the power of **Ensemble Boosting Machine Learning** to detect and mitigate **DDoS attacks** with **98.42% accuracy**.  

 
ðŸ”¹ **DDoS attacks** are among the most **disruptive cyber threats**, crippling businesses and online services.  
ðŸ”¹ **Traditional detection methods** often fail against **new & evolving attack vectors**.  
ðŸ”¹ **Solution?** A robust **AI-driven model** that detects malicious traffic in real-time.

##  Key Features  
âœ… **Ensemble Boosting Model** for high-accuracy classification  
âœ… **Trained on real-world DDoS attack data (CICIDS2017)**  
âœ… **Identifies multiple attack types**: TCP Flood, UDP Flood, HTTP Flood  
âœ… **Achieves 99.99% Accuracy, 99.9% Precision, and 99.8% Recall**  
âœ… **Fast & Scalable Solution** for real-time deployment

##  How It Works  
 **This system learns from network traffic patterns to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activity.**  

###  Methodology  
1 **Feature Extraction** - Identifying key traffic parameters (**packet rate, byte rate, protocol distribution**)  
2 **Model Training** - Applying **Boosting-based ensemble learning** for better accuracy  
3 **Performance Evaluation** - Measured using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score & MCC**  

 **Base Model Used**: **Random Forest Classifier** with boosting techniques
